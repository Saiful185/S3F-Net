# **Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S³F-Net) Explainability Analysis**
This folder contains the full implementation of **S³F-Net** explainability analysis, on all datasets. We use L2 Norm and our proposed custom **Balanced Contribution Score** to quantify the contribution of each branch (spatial and spectral).
